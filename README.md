Description:
Climate Changer is a dynamic web application that simulates seasonal changes and displays temperature variations. Users can interact with the website to switch between different seasons, and the application automatically updates the visuals and temperature data accordingly.

How It Works:
Seasonal Change: Users can select different seasons (e.g., Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter).
Automatic Updates: The site dynamically updates its background, visuals, and temperature data to reflect the chosen season.
Temperature Display: Shows the current temperature relevant to the selected season.

Technologies Used
HTML: Structures the content and season options.
CSS: Styles the application and season-based visuals.
JavaScript: Handles user interactions, updates visuals, and manages temperature data.
